# MikroTik Prometheus
This is prometheus custom image for running on MikroTik RouterOS. If you want to try, make sure to build the image first, and then push it to docker registry (ex: Docker Hub). After that you can pull from the MikroTik.

For example, you can try using the artifact I created on Docker Hub.

```bash
  docker pull wehape/mikrotik-prometheus
```

```bash
  docker pull wehape/mikrotik-snmp-exporter
```
